  "visual_reasoning_patterns": [
    "Here is a simple bullet list summarizing the author's VISUAL reasoning patterns:",
    "**Abstraction**: The author often uses visual representations to simplify complex ideas, breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components.",
    "**Validation**: Many diagrams and flowcharts are used to validate concepts, processes, or algorithms, providing a clear structure or framework for understanding and evaluating their effectiveness.",
    "**Intuition**: Visualizations can be used to facilitate intuition by allowing learners to visualize the structure and flow of a process or algorithm before diving into details.",
    "**Guiding problem-solving**: The author's visual representations often guide problem-solving by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable components, encouraging a structured and logical approach to solving problems.",
    "**Encouraging critical thinking**: Visual metaphors are used to encourage viewers to think critically about complexity, maze-solving, or the intricate nature of programming and algorithmic thinking."
